            <p>Gazing at the Bo tree - In gratitude to the tree that had sheltered Him during His struggle for
                Buddhahood, the Buddha stood without moving His eyes as He meditated on the Bo tree (Animisalochana
                Pooja), thus teaching a great moral lesson to the world. Buddhists who follow this example pay their
                respects not only to the original Bo tree, but also other Bo trees.</p>

            <p>Under the Bo tree - During the first week after Enlightenment, the Buddha sat under the Bo tree,
                experiencing the happiness of freedom and peace. Throughout the week, He sat in one posture,
                experiencing the Bliss of Emancipation
                (Vimukthi Suva)</p>

            <p>Golden bridge - The Buddha saw through His mind’s eye that the gods were not sure whether He had attained
                Enlightenment, as the Buddha had not given up His temporary residence at the Bo tree. To clear their
                doubts, He created, by His psychic powers, a golden bridge in the air, and walked up and down it for a
                whole week.</p>

            <p>In the jewelled chamber - The Buddha created a beautiful jewelled chamber (ratanaghara) and sitting
                inside it, meditated on what was later known as the ‘Detailed Teaching’ (Abhidhamma). His mind and body
                were so purified that rays of six colours came out of His body - blue, yellow, red, white, orange and a
                mixture of these five. Each colour represented one noble quality of the Buddha: yellow for holiness,
                white for purity, blue for confidence, red for wisdom and orange for defeat of desire. The mixed colour
                represented all these noble qualities. Today these six colours make up the Buddhist flag.</p>

            <p>With a Brahmana and three girls - While meditating under the Ajapala banyan tree, the Buddha replied to a
                Brahmana, who came to see Him, that one becomes a perfect Brahmana by one’s deeds and not by birth.
                Three charming girls called Tanha, Rati and Raga (the daughters of Mara) came to disturb His meditation.
                They danced around the Buddha and tried to distract Him, but soon got tired and left Him alone.</p>

            <p>Under the muchalinda tree - The Buddha started meditating under a muchalinda tree. It began to rain
                heavily and the huge Muchalinda Nagaraja (cobra king) came out and coiled his body seven times around
                the Buddha to keep Him warm and placed his hood over the Buddha’s head to protect Him from the rain.
                After seven days, the rain stopped and the snake changed into a young man who paid his respects to the
                Buddha.</p>

            <p>Under the Rajayatana tree - The Buddha meditated under the Rajayatana banyan tree. Two merchants, Tapassu
                and Bhalluka, came into His presence and offered the Buddha rice cakes and honey. The Buddha told them
                some of what He had found in His Enlightenment. These two merchants, by taking refuge in the Buddha and
                His Dhamma, became the first lay followers in the Buddhist world. There was no Sangha (order of monks
                and nuns) then. They asked the Buddha for something sacred and the Buddha wiped His head with His right
                hand and pulled out some hair to give them. These hair relics (Kesa Datu) were brought home and
                enshrined by the merchants.</p>
